To get started, clone the repo and install the needed gems using:

$ bundle install

Then, migrate the database

$ rake db:migrate

Finally, run a local server...

$ rails server

And navigate to localhost:3000 in your web browser. If you run into any problem, check to make sure that your server port is set to 3000 and update where necessary.
